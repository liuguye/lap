# Introduction

**Lap** is a local-first photo manager built for people who want fast browsing, practical organization tools, and private on-device search.

## Why Lap?

Most photo apps force a tradeoff: either you get a simple folder viewer with very limited tools, or you upload your library to a cloud service that scans everything for you.

Lap is designed to avoid that compromise.

It works directly with your existing folders, keeps your library on your own device, and adds modern search and organization features without turning your photo collection into a cloud product.

### Key Features

- **Local First**: Your photos stay on your own disk. No mandatory cloud upload, no cloud indexing.
- **Fast Browsing**: Built with Rust and Tauri, with a rebuilt scanner and optimized local database for large libraries.
- **AI Search on Device**: Search with natural language, similar-image search, face clustering, and smart tags, all processed locally.
- **Multilingual Search**: Search in 50+ languages with optional multilingual models, available as an additional download when needed.
- **Practical Organization**: Use favorites, ratings, tags, comments, camera and lens grouping, and duplicate detection to keep collections organized.
- **Broad Video Support**: Open MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, and 20+ other video formats across platforms.
- **Built-in Editing Tools**: Quickly crop, rotate, adjust, and save changes without leaving the app.
- **Folder-Based Workflow**: Lap reflects your real folder structure instead of forcing an import-only library model.
